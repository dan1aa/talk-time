      <h3>Grouping</h3>

      <p>Ad-hoc Grouping allows you to optionally assign each participant any of 4 groups: A, B, C, or D. The group total time includes everyone who is marked as being a part of that group.</p>

      <div class="text-center"><img src="screenshot-2.png" style="border:1px solid white;max-width:100%;"/></div>

      <p>Use it to track total time spent talking by your company vs your client, or men versus women, or teachers and students, etc. You can group participants however you wish, on the fly.</p>

      <h3>FAQ</h3>

      <p><b>Q: Does it work for Zoom, Teams, Skype, etc?</b></p>
      <p>A: No, not right now. Only Google Meet. Stay tuned.</p>

      <p><b>Q: Is it accurate?</b></p>
      <p>A: It is accurate within a few seconds over a 1-hour meeting.</p>

      <p><b>Q: Why does it stop working when I close the right panel?</b></p>
      <p>A: The Participants panel is used to see and track who is talking. If you close it, tracking stops.</p>

      <p><b>Q: Can participants be included in multiple groups?</b></p>
      <p>A: Yes.</p>

      <p><b>Q: What does "Total Talk Time" mean?</b></p>
      <p>A: It's the total time that at least one person was talking, not the total duration of the meeting.</p>

      <p><b>Q: If I switch to the Messages/Chat panel does the tracking stop?</b></p>
      <p>A: No, it only stops if you close the right panel entirely.</p>
